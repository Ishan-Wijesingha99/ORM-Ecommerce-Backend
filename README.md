# ORM-Ecommerce-Backend

## Description
This application contains the backend for an E-commerce site. With GET requests, POST requests, PUT requests and DELETE requests. 

The GET requests will return a JSON array with many JSON objects. These JSON objects either represent a category, a product or a tag on the E-ccommerce site. Route parameters can also be used in the URL of the GET request to return only a specific JSON object in the entire JSON array.

The POST requests can be used to add a particular JSON object to the entire JSON array. The new JSON object is sent in the body of the POST request.

The PUT requests can be used to change a particular JSON object in the entire JSON array. A route parameter is used in the URL to indicate which JSON object in the JSON array is to be changed. The new JSON object is sent in the body of the PUT request.

The DELETE requests can be used to delete a particular JSON object in the entire JSON array. A route paramter is used in the URL to indicate which JSON object in the JSON array is to be deleted.
